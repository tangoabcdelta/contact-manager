## Steps to run the app
* Install all dependencies: nodejs, npm, bower, bash compatible shell/terminal/command-line/cmder etc
* Do an `npm start` for the very-first-time
* Subsequent demos can be launched by issuing a `grut` at the terminal
* To start the node-development server @port:3000, go to terminal and run: `node www`
* To trigger a build and watch, go to terminal and run `grunt`

## Unit Testing
* 30% code coverage
* Run `grunt jasmine-unit` at terminal
* Run `node testserver`, if in case the automatic initialization fails
